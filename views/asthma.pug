                 <li>Lie on your belly on your mat, with a blanket under your pelvis if needed. Press all of your toes into the floor and then bend your knees, keeping the toes active.
                  </li>
                  <li>Grab the outer edges of your ankles with your hands and flex your feet strongly.</li>
                  <li>On an inhalation, lift your rib cage and shoulders toward your ears. On an exhalation, lengthen your tailbone and kick your legs back into your hands as you hold on firmly</li>
                  <li>From here, lift your head and heart. Gaze forward. Extend through the roof of your mouth and crown of your head. As you do so, always keep strong energy moving from the base of your spine through the crown of your head to help support
                  </li>
                  <li>Stay lifted for 5 breaths</li>

             <h4>Virasana (Hero pose)</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li>Kneel on the floor (use a folded blanket or bolster to wedge between your calves and thighs if necessary), with your thighs perpendicular to the floor, and touch your inner knees together. Slide your feet apart, slightly wider than your hips, with the tops of the feet flat on the floor. Angle your big toes slightly in toward each other and press the top of each foot evenly on the floor.
                 </li>
                 <li>Exhale and sit back halfway, with your torso leaning slightly forward. Wedge your thumbs into the backs of your knees and draw the skin and flesh of the calf muscles toward the heels. Then sit down between your feet.</li>
                 <li>If your buttocks don’t comfortably rest on the floor, raise them on a block or thick book placed between the feet. Make sure both sitting bones are evenly supported. Allow a thumb’s-width space between the inner heels and the outer hips. Turn your thighs inward and press the heads of the thigh bones into the floor with the bases of your palms. Then lay your hands in your lap, one on the other, palms up, or on your thighs, palms down.</li>
                 <li>Firm your shoulder blades against the back ribs and lift the top of your sternum like a proud warrior. Widen the collarbones and release the shoulder blades away from the ears. Lengthen the tailbone into the floor to anchor the back torso.
                 </li>
                 <li>At first stay in this pose from 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gradually extend your stay up to 5 minutes. To come out, press your hands against the floor and lift your buttocks up, slightly higher than the heels. Cross your ankles underneath your buttocks, sit back over the feet and onto the floor, then stretch your legs out in front of you. It may feel good to bounce your knees up and down a few times on the floor.</li>

             <h4>Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle pose)</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li>Stand and step or lightly jump your feet 3 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms parallel to the floor and reach them actively to the sides, shoulder blades wide, palms down.
                 </li>
                 <li>Turn your left foot in slightly and your right foot out to 90 degrees. Align your right heel with your left heel. Firm your thighs and turn your right thigh outward, so the center of your right kneecap is in line with the center of the right ankle.</li>
                 <li>Exhale and extend your torso to the right, directly over the plane of your right leg, bending from the hip joint, not the waist. Anchor this movement by strengthening your left leg and pressing your outer heel firmly to the floor. Rotate your torso to the left, keeping the left and right sides of your torso equally long. Let your left hip come slightly forward and lengthen your tailbone toward the back heel.</li>
                 <li>Rest your right hand on your shin or ankle or the floor outside your right foot—whatever is possible without distorting the sides of your torso. Stretch your left arm toward the ceiling, in line with the tops of your shoulders. Keep your head in a neutral position or turn it to the left, eyes gazing softly at your left thumb.
                 </li>
                 <li>Stay in this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. Inhale to come up, strongly pressing your back heel into the floor and reaching your top arm toward the ceiling. Reverse your e feet and repeat for the same length of time on the other side.</li>

                 <li>On an exhalation, extend your torso down without rounding your back. Lengthen your neck, extending the crown of your head toward the ground, while you draw your shoulders down your back toward your hips.

             <h4>Urdhva Dhanurasana (Upward-Facing Bow pose)</h4>
             <ol>
                 <li>Begin on your back with your knees bent and your feet planted hip-distance apart and parallel, directly under your knees, which should also be hip-distance apart.
                 </li>
                 <li>Place your hands alongside your ears with your palms down and your fingers pointing toward your shoulders.</li>
                 <li>Without letting your feet or your knees splay apart, take an inhalation, then use an exhalation to lift yourself partway and place the crown of your head on the mat. Do not rest any of your weight on your head.</li>
                 <li>Pin your elbows into your midline, draw your elbows toward one another, pull your upper arms into their sockets, and start to arch your middle and upper back.
                 </li>
                 <li>Maintaining all these actions, with the next inhalation, press down with your hands and feet, and lift into the pose.</li>
                 <li>Straighten your arms as much as possible but keep at least a slight bend in your knees.</li>
                 <li>Make sure your feet have not turned out, and root down with your big toe mounds.</li>
                 <li>Rotate your inner thighs to the floor, and reach your tailbone toward your feet toward the backs of your knees. Let your head hang freely, and lift your sternum in the direction you are facing while directing your tailbone toward your feet.</li>
                 <li>To deepen, walk your feet closer to your hands, keeping your forearms and shins perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other.</li>
                 <li>Hold for 5–10 breaths (walk your feet out if they had moved in), then lower directly to the floor (without stopping on the crown).</li>
